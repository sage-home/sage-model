Today you will be working on the attached implementation plan. The plan is broken down into steps such that you only need to work on one file/function at a time. You will follow this plan EXACTLY. If you are unsure about something or have multiple options, you are to stop and explain and ask for input. Otherwise, please implement the plan as written.

Always keep `todays-edits.md` updated as instructed.
