// This header can be used for declarations specific to the pipeline registry tests.
// For now, it's a placeholder. If CuTest or another framework was being used,
// relevant includes would go here.

// Example:
// void test_pipeline_registration_and_creation(CuTest *tc);
// CuSuite* PipelineRegistryGetSuite(void);

// Since we are creating a standalone test, we might not need much here yet.
// But it's good practice to have a corresponding header.
