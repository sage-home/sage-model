# Physics-Free SAGE Model

## Overview

The Physics-Free SAGE Model demonstrates complete core-physics separation where the core infrastructure operates with empty pipelines - no modules whatsoever. This validates true physics-agnostic execution where properties pass directly from input to output.

## Architecture

### Core-Physics Separation

The core infrastructure is completely physics-agnostic:

1. **GALAXY Struct**: Contains only essential infrastructure fields (identifiers, tree navigation, extension pointers). All physics fields removed.

2. **Properties System**: All physical state managed through dynamically generated `galaxy_properties_t` struct from `properties.yaml`.

3. **Pipeline System**: Pipeline executor has no physics knowledge. Executes phases without requiring modules.

4. **Essential Physics Functions**: Minimal implementations in `physics_essential_functions.c` provide core-required functions (`init_galaxy`, virial calculations, merger stubs) enabling physics-free operation.

### Empty Pipeline Execution

When no configuration file is provided:
- Empty pipeline created with zero modules
- Core properties pass from input to output unchanged
- Physics properties output at initial values (typically 0.0)
- All pipeline phases execute gracefully

## Testing Methodology

### Physics-Free Mode Validation

1. **Physics-Free Mode Test** (`test_physics_free_mode`): Validates empty pipeline execution with zero modules.
2. **Core-Physics Separation Tests**: Multiple tests verify core independence from physics.
3. **Property System Tests**: Validate property pass-through without physics operations.

### Example Execution

```bash
./sage millennium.par  # No config file = empty pipeline
```

This runs SAGE in physics-free mode, demonstrating core infrastructure independence.

## Benefits

1. **True Separation**: Core never depends on specific physics implementations
2. **Runtime Modularity**: Physics modules are pure add-ons
3. **Testing Foundation**: Validates core infrastructure independently
4. **Development Framework**: Clean foundation for physics module development

## Future Development

Physics modules will be implemented as pure add-ons that register with the core at runtime, maintaining complete separation while enabling full scientific functionality.
