# Current Phase: 1.3-1.4/7 (Testing Framework & Documentation Enhancement)

## Phase Objectives
- Complete Phase 1.3: Testing Framework Implementation
  - Create a comprehensive testing framework without external dependencies
  - Implement unit tests for parameter views and core components
  - Develop benchmarking tools for performance measurement
  - Create validation tests for scientific outputs

- Complete Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
  - Create architectural documentation with component relationships
  - Document data flow between core and physics modules
  - Update inline documentation with clear purpose for each function
  - Create comprehensive README and developer guides

## Current Progress

### Phase 1.3: Testing Framework Implementation
- [x] GSL Dependency Removal (Prerequisite)
- [x] End-to-end integration tests (basic)
- [ ] Unit testing framework implementation
- [ ] Parameter view unit tests
- [ ] Evolution context tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking framework
- [ ] Scientific validation tests

### Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
- [x] Basic inline documentation
- [x] Updated README.md with new structure
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Data flow documentation
- [ ] Component relationship diagrams
- [ ] Developer guide

## Next Actions
1. Create `test_utils.h` with testing macros and utilities
2. Implement unit tests for all parameter views
3. Create tests for evolution context
4. Develop benchmark framework for performance evaluation
5. Create architecture documentation with component diagrams
6. Document data flow between components

## Completion Criteria
- End-to-end tests passing with current implementation
- Unit tests for all parameter views with >90% coverage
- Performance benchmarks established as baseline
- Complete architectural and data flow documentation
- Updated inline documentation across all core components
