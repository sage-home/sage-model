# Phase 4.6 Step 3: Automatic Debug Context Lifecycle Management

## Overview

This implementation adds automatic lifecycle management for module debug contexts, making them consistent with how error contexts are handled in the SAGE module system. 

## Problem Statement

Unlike error contexts (which are automatically initialized in `module_initialize`), debug contexts previously required manual initialization and cleanup by module developers. This inconsistency created potential for resource leaks and placed unnecessary burden on module developers.

## Implementation Details

The implementation makes the following key changes:

1. Modified `module_initialize` to automatically initialize debug contexts if they don't already exist:
   - Added call to `module_debug_context_init` 
   - Added error handling similar to error context initialization
   - Made initialization non-fatal to allow modules to function without debugging

2. Modified `module_cleanup` to automatically clean up debug contexts:
   - Uncommented and enabled the debug context cleanup code
   - Ensured proper resource release with call to `module_debug_context_cleanup`

## Benefits

These changes provide several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Debug context lifecycle now matches error context lifecycle
2. **Reduced Burden**: Module developers no longer need to manage debug contexts manually
3. **Improved Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks
4. **Simplified Debugging**: Debug contexts are always available for all modules

## Validation

The changes were validated by:

1. Running the existing module debug tests: `tests/test_module_debug`
2. Running the full SAGE test suite: `make tests`

## Impact

This enhancement is non-invasive and doesn't change any existing module behavior. Modules that previously managed their debug contexts manually will continue to work, as the automatic initialization only occurs if a debug context doesn't already exist.

## Future Work

No additional work is required for debug context lifecycle management. Debug contexts are now fully integrated into the module system lifecycle.
