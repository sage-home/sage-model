# Explanation: "nonexistent_file.dat" Error Message

## Overview

When running `make tests`, you may see the following error message:

```
Error message for non-existent file: Failed to open file 'nonexistent_file.dat': No such file or directory
```

## Explanation

This is **not actually an error** but part of a successful test in `tests/test_io_memory_map.c`. The test is specifically designed to verify that the memory mapping system correctly handles the case when a user tries to map a file that doesn't exist.

Looking at the test file (around line 170), there's a test function called `test_error_handling()` that intentionally attempts to map a non-existent file to ensure the error handling code works properly:

```c
void test_error_handling() {
    // Try to map non-existent file
    struct mmap_options options = mmap_default_options();
    struct mmap_region* region = mmap_file("nonexistent_file.dat", -1, &options);
    
    if (region != NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Expected mapping failure for non-existent file\n");
        TEST_FAILED;
    }
    
    const char* error = mmap_get_error();
    if (error == NULL || strlen(error) == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Expected error message for failed mapping\n");
        TEST_FAILED;
    }
    
    printf("Error message for non-existent file: %s\n", error);
    
    TEST_PASSED;
}
```

This test function:
1. Attempts to open a non-existent file
2. Verifies that the mapping operation fails (returns NULL)
3. Verifies that an error message is generated
4. Prints the error message to stdout
5. Indicates the test passed

## Conclusion

The message is expected behavior from a successfully passing test and doesn't indicate any problem with the codebase. The memory mapping system is correctly detecting and handling the error case of trying to map a file that doesn't exist.

If you'd prefer not to see this message, you could modify the test to redirect this specific message to stderr instead of stdout, but it's not necessary for proper functioning of the tests.
