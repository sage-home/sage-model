# Phase 3.2 Step 8.1: ConsistentTrees HDF5 Format Handler Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds the ConsistentTrees HDF5 format handler to the I/O interface system. Due to the lack of test data files for this format, the implementation follows a stub approach similar to what was done for the LHalo HDF5 handler, focusing on the interface definition and registration rather than the full reading functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **src/io/io_consistent_trees_hdf5.h**
   - Defines the interface for the ConsistentTrees HDF5 format handler
   - Includes format-specific data structure definition
   - Declares interface functions and helper functions

2. **tests/test_consistent_trees_hdf5.c**
   - Creates a test suite for the ConsistentTrees HDF5 handler
   - Tests format detection and handler registration
   - Verifies handler capabilities

### Files Modified

1. **src/io/io_interface.c**
   - Added stub implementation for the ConsistentTrees HDF5 handler
   - Added handler registration in io_init()
   - Added format detection in io_detect_format()

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a stub approach, similar to what was done for the LHalo HDF5 handler:

1. **Handler Definition**: A static handler structure with metadata, capabilities, and NULL function pointers.
2. **Format Detection**: A simple extension-based detection function that recognizes .hdf5 and .h5 files.
3. **Handler Registration**: Function to register the handler with the I/O interface system.
4. **Testing**: Test cases that verify handler registration and capabilities.

## Future Work

To complete the implementation, the following steps would be needed:

1. **Format-Specific Reading**: Implement the actual forest reading functionality based on the ConsistentTrees HDF5 format specification.
2. **Content-Based Detection**: Enhance the format detection to look for ConsistentTrees-specific markers in HDF5 files.
3. **Resource Management**: Implement proper HDF5 resource tracking for the handler.
4. **Testing with Real Data**: Create or obtain ConsistentTrees HDF5 test files and implement forest reading tests.

## Build and Test Status

The implementation was designed to be compiled with the existing build system when HDF5 support is enabled. Due to limitations in the test environment, a simplified test was created that validates the presence of the framework rather than testing functionality directly.

The simplified test confirms:
- The interface has been properly defined in io_consistent_trees_hdf5.h
- The handler registration is implemented in io_interface.c
- Format detection for ConsistentTrees HDF5 files is in place
- The test framework follows the pattern used for other handlers

Since the implementation uses stub functions, actual forest reading is not yet supported. This is clearly documented in the code with appropriate TODO comments.

## Conclusion

This implementation lays the groundwork for supporting ConsistentTrees HDF5 format in the SAGE model by establishing the interface structure and registration mechanism. The stub approach allows for incremental development while maintaining a clean architecture.
