# SAGE Model Python Dependencies
# ==============================
# 
# This file contains all Python dependencies needed to run Python scripts
# and tools in the SAGE (Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution) model repository.
# 
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core Scientific Computing Dependencies
# --------------------------------------
# Required for numerical operations and data analysis
numpy>=1.18.0
matplotlib>=3.2.0
h5py>=2.10.0

# Python-C Interface
# ------------------
# Required for sage.py Python interface to SAGE C code
cffi>=1.14.0

# Configuration and Data Processing
# ---------------------------------
# Required for property system generation from YAML files
PyYAML>=5.3.0

# Progress Bars and User Interface
# --------------------------------
# Optional but recommended for better user experience
tqdm>=4.50.0

# Optional Dependencies
# ---------------------
# These provide additional functionality but are not required for basic operation

# MPI support for parallel processing (optional)
# Requires MPI libraries (OpenMPI, MPICH, etc.) to be installed separately
# mpi4py>=3.0.0

# External SAGE analysis package (for sage-analysis-examples)
# This is a separate package developed by the SAGE team
# sage-analysis>=0.2.4

# Development and Testing Dependencies
# ------------------------------------
# These are included in Python 3.2+ but listed for completeness

# argparse - Command line argument parsing (included in Python 3.2+)
# pathlib - Object-oriented filesystem paths (included in Python 3.4+)

# System Requirements Notes
# ========================
# 
# 1. Python 3.6+ is required
# 2. HDF5 C libraries must be installed separately for h5py support
# 3. For MPI support, install an MPI implementation (OpenMPI, MPICH, Intel MPI)
# 4. LaTeX installation is optional but recommended for high-quality plot text rendering
# 
# Platform-specific installation notes:
# 
# Ubuntu/Debian:
#   sudo apt-get install python3-dev libhdf5-dev libopenmpi-dev
# 
# macOS (with Homebrew):
#   brew install hdf5 open-mpi
# 
# CentOS/RHEL:
#   sudo yum install python3-devel hdf5-devel openmpi-devel
