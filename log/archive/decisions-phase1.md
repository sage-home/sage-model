# Phase 1 Architectural Decisions Archive

*Historical decisions from Phase 1 (Infrastructure Foundation) - active decisions in `../decisions.md`*

**Instructions for Archiving:**
- At phase completion, move current decisions from `../decisions.md` to this file
- Rename file to `decisions-phase1.md` and create new `decisions-phase2.md`
- Maintain chronological order within each phase
- Keep 100-word limit per entry for conciseness

**Example Format:**
```
2025-XX-XX: [Phase 1.X] Decision Title
- **Decision**: Brief description of the decision made
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made (technical/scientific reasons)
- **Impact**: Effect on current and future development
```

*This file will be populated when Phase 1 is complete and decisions need to be archived.*
