<!-- Purpose: Record todays work to avoid duplication / forgotten work -->
<!-- Update Rules:
- A "group of edits" are changes made to a single function/file/struct/variable/etc, or a new file
- ALWAYS refer to this file BEFORE starting a new group of edits to avoid duplication
- ALWAYS write to this file AFTER finishing a group of edits before moving on
- Must have the following format:
  â€¢ <today's date> <24hr time right now>: <new/edit/removed> <function/file/struct/variable/etc> in <filename> - <short description of change>
  â€¢ E.g. 2025-04-23 09:34: edit function `evolve_galaxies()` in `src/core/core_build_model.c` - Integrated evolution diagnostics into galaxy evolution pipeline
  â€¢ E.g. 2025-04-24 13:10: new file `src/core/core_evolution_diagnostics.c` - Created implementation file for evolution diagnostics system
- Record new edits even when they're to something that's already been recorded here
- Always add to bottom of list
- If you discover duplication go back and check the code, then report and stop for instructions
