## Core-Physics Property Separation in save_gals_hdf5.c

### Files Created
- src/io/save_gals_hdf5_property_utils.c: New utility functions for property system integration
- src/io/prepare_galaxy_for_hdf5_output.c: Refactored property-sensitive galaxy preparation 
- src/io/generate_field_metadata.c: Dynamic field metadata generation from property metadata
- src/io/trigger_buffer_write.c: Property-agnostic buffer writing system
- src/io/initialize_hdf5_galaxy_files.c: Updated initialization with property system integration
- src/io/finalize_hdf5_galaxy_files.c: Updated finalization with proper property cleanup
- tests/test_property_system_hdf5.c: Test file for property-based HDF5 output

### Files Modified
- src/io/save_gals_hdf5.c: Updated to use the property system for accessing physics properties
- src/io/save_gals_hdf5.h: Updated with dynamic property buffer structure

### Changes Summary
1. Implemented dynamic property discovery based on metadata from `properties.yaml`
2. Replaced hardcoded memory allocation with property-based allocation
3. Refactored `prepare_galaxy_for_hdf5_output()` to use property system API
   - Core properties accessed directly via `GALAXY_PROP_*` macros
   - Physics properties accessed via `get_float_property()`, `get_cached_property_id()`, etc.
4. Updated field metadata generation to derive from property metadata
5. Modified buffer writing to be property-agnostic with dynamic type handling
6. Added proper cleanup for property resources

### Architecture
The updated code respects the core-physics separation principle:
- Core properties (from `core_properties.yaml`) are accessed directly using `GALAXY_PROP_*` macros
- Physics properties (from `properties.yaml`) are accessed via the generic property system functions
- The system is now completely metadata-driven, discovering properties at runtime

### Testing
Created a basic test file for the property-based HDF5 output system that validates the structure.
The full validation will be done through the existing test framework.
