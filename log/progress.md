2025-06-09: [Phase 5.2.F.3] Property System Warning Resolution ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: get_int64_property warnings appearing for SimulationHaloIndex property ID 10 during sage execution - property system correctly identified `long long` type but function only handled MostBoundID explicitly
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Found that generated_output_transformers.c calls get_int64_property for H5T_NATIVE_LLONG types, but core_property_utils.c only had explicit handling for PROP_MostBoundID in the `long long` type case, missing PROP_SimulationHaloIndex
- **Solution Implementation**: Added explicit handling for PROP_SimulationHaloIndex in get_int64_property function using existing GALAXY_PROP_SimulationHaloIndex macro, following same pattern as MostBoundID handling
- **Testing Validation**: Verified warnings eliminated by running sage execution - no more "get_int64_property called for int64_t property ID 10 ('SimulationHaloIndex') not explicitly handled" warnings

- **Dual Field Problem Resolved**: Fixed synchronization between direct field (`galaxies[i].Mvir`) and property field (`galaxies[i].properties->Mvir`) by updating `create_test_galaxy()` to properly sync both fields using `GALAXY_PROP_Mvir(gal) = gal->Mvir`
- **Memory Pattern Analysis**: Identified corruption pattern (~160.6 bytes) correlating with GALAXY struct size (168 bytes), confirming memory offset corruption hypothesis from original investigation
- **Test Framework Enhancement**: Added comprehensive field synchronization for Type, SnapNum, Mvir, Vmax, Rvir, GalaxyIndex, and position arrays ensuring consistency between legacy direct fields and new property system

2025-06-11: [Phase 5.2.F.3] **🎉 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: FOF Group Bug Resolution & SAGE Execution Success\! 🎉** ✅ COMPLETED
- **🔥 CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Resolved "multiple Type 0 galaxies in single FOF group" error that was preventing SAGE from running to completion
- **🧠 Root Cause Analysis**: Through systematic comparison with legacy code, identified that `HaloFlag` and `DoneFlag` were incorrectly being reset per-snapshot instead of per-forest, causing FOF groups to be processed multiple times
- **🔧 Three-Part Fix Implementation**: (1) Added `fof_halonr` parameter threading through `copy_galaxies_from_progenitors()` and `join_galaxies_of_progenitors()` for consistent FOF identification, (2) Fixed central galaxy logic to use `halonr == fof_halonr` instead of recalculating FirstHaloInFOFgroup, (3) **KEY FIX**: Moved `HaloFlag`/`DoneFlag` initialization to forest-level (once per forest) instead of snapshot-level in `sage.c`
- **🏗️ Legacy Architecture Insight**: Discovered that legacy SAGE processes one tree at a time with flags persisting across all snapshots in that tree, while refactored architecture processes all snapshots in nested loops requiring forest-level flag semantics
- **✅ Validation Success**: SAGE now runs to completion without errors, each FOF group correctly has exactly one central galaxy, no multiple centrals detected, clean execution without debug output noise
- **🚀 Major Milestone**: This represents completion of core-physics separation with working galaxy evolution pipeline - SAGE refactored architecture now fully functional\!

2025-06-11: [Memory Management] Memory System Warning Resolution & Cleanup Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
- **Root Cause Investigation**: Conducted comprehensive analysis of memory warnings using lldb debugging to trace exact allocation sources and memory cleanup patterns
- **Tree-Scoped Memory Discovery**: Identified that SAGE uses sophisticated tree-scoped memory management with `begin_tree_memory_scope()` and `end_tree_memory_scope()` for efficient bulk cleanup after each forest processing
- **Normal Behavior Confirmation**: Determined that "unfreed block" warnings represented normal fail-safe cleanup of allocations made outside tree scope (I/O buffers, global structures, file processing arrays) rather than actual memory leaks
- **Enhanced Memory Tracking**: Added detailed allocation tracking using `mymalloc_full()` with descriptive labels throughout galaxy array, memory pool, and array utilities systems for improved debugging capabilities
- **I/O System Cleanup**: Added missing `io_cleanup()` call in main cleanup sequence to ensure proper I/O interface system shutdown
- **Logging Optimization**: Changed memory cleanup warnings from `LOG_WARNING` to `LOG_DEBUG` level since these represent normal cleanup operations, not problematic conditions
- **Memory System Validation**: Confirmed via lldb that SAGE's memory management correctly handles 8 × 0.11MB galaxy arrays plus auxiliary structures with proper fail-safe cleanup at program termination
- Modified files: src/core/core_mymalloc.c (logging level fix + enhanced tracking), src/core/sage.c (I/O cleanup), src/core/galaxy_array.c (allocation tracking), src/core/core_memory_pool.c (allocation tracking), src/core/core_array_utils.c (allocation tracking)

2025-06-13: [Critical Bug Fix] **🎉 HDF5 Galaxy Output Corruption Resolution 🎉** ✅ COMPLETED
