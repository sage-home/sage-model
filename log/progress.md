# Recent Progress Log

2025-08-21: [Phase 1.1-1.2] Infrastructure Foundation Setup
- Completed CMake build system setup and directory reorganization per master plan Tasks 1.1-1.2
- Implemented modern CMake build with dependency detection, out-of-tree builds, and zero-warning compilation
- Achieved clean core/physics/io separation with preserved git history using git mv commands
- Established professional development foundation with IDE integration ready for property system implementation
- **Files Created**: CMakeLists.txt, log/*.md (initial architecture docs)
- **Files Modified**: .gitignore, CLAUDE.md, README.rst, all src files moved to new structure

2025-08-22: [Phase 1.5] Development Logging System Setup
- Implemented comprehensive logging system per master plan Task 1.5 with decisions.md, phase.md, architecture.md using proper headers from log-refactor reference
- Established archive/ structure with instructions for phase transitions and historical tracking
- Updated CLAUDE.md with logging guidelines enabling persistent development context across AI sessions
- **Files Created**: log/decisions.md, log/phase.md, log/architecture.md, log/archive/, log/archive/decisions-phase1.md, log/archive/progress-phase1.md
- **Files Modified**: CLAUDE.md (added logging system documentation)

2025-08-22: [Task 1.3] Memory Abstraction Layer Implementation Complete
- Successfully implemented complete memory abstraction layer replacing legacy mymalloc system per Task 1.3 plan
- Delivered all objectives: standard debugging tools compatibility, removed MAXBLOCKS=2048 limit, optional tracking, backward compatibility, RAII foundation
- Achieved 100% test pass rate including scientific validation, AddressSanitizer integration, and legacy compatibility
- Professional-grade implementation with comprehensive testing and independent code review (Grade A-)
- **Files Created**: src/core/memory.h, src/core/memory.c, src/core/memory_scope.h, src/core/memory_scope.c, tests/test_memory.c, log/task-1.3-minor-improvements-addendum.md
- **Files Modified**: src/core/core_mymalloc.h, src/core/core_mymalloc.c, CMakeLists.txt (added memory options and sources)

2025-08-22: [Task 1.3 Minor Improvements] Memory Abstraction Layer Robustness Enhancements
- Implemented minor robustness improvements identified in addendum: tracking allocation failure handling with graceful degradation and memory scope realloc error checking
- Enhanced error handling prevents cascading failures in memory-constrained environments while maintaining system stability
- Added comprehensive error path testing and fixed missing stdio.h include for complete professional implementation
- All tests pass including new error condition validation, maintaining 100% backward compatibility and scientific accuracy
- **Files Modified**: src/core/memory.c, src/core/memory_scope.c, tests/test_memory.c
