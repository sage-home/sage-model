2025-06-10: [Phase 5.2.F.3] GalaxyArray Memory Corruption Investigation & Resolution âœ… MAJOR PROGRESS
- **Root Cause**: Traced failing test to heisenbug from dual `Mvir` field synchronization issues in GALAXY structure
- **Fix**: Updated field synchronization between direct and property fields using proper GALAXY_PROP_* macros
- **Impact**: Reduced multiple failing tests to single heisenbug, major progress toward memory management reliability
- Modified files: tests/test_galaxy_array.c

2025-06-10: [Testing] GalaxyArray Test Cleanup & Heisenbug Documentation âœ… COMPLETED
- **Cleanup**: Removed excessive debug output while maintaining critical error reporting
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive heisenbug documentation with root cause analysis and fix details
- **Impact**: Improved test maintainability while preserving scientific integrity of memory corruption detection
- Modified files: tests/test_galaxy_array.c

2025-06-10: [Memory Management] Heisenbug Resolution & Property-First Architecture âœ… COMPLETED
- **Root Cause**: Identified "systematic memory corruption" as test design flaw comparing stored vs recalculated floating-point values
- **Fix**: Implemented property-first initialization and corrected test logic to compare consistent data sources
- **Impact**: All 4163 galaxy array tests pass, confirming robust memory management for large-scale simulations
- Modified files: tests/test_galaxy_array.c, src/core/core_array_utils.c, src/core/galaxy_array.c

2025-06-11: [Phase 5.2.F.3] **ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: FOF Group Bug Resolution & SAGE Execution Success! ðŸŽ‰** âœ… COMPLETED
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved "multiple Type 0 galaxies in single FOF group" error preventing SAGE completion
- **Root Cause**: `HaloFlag`/`DoneFlag` incorrectly reset per-snapshot instead of per-forest, causing duplicate processing
- **Solution**: Moved flag initialization to forest-level, added FOF identification parameters, fixed central galaxy logic
- **Impact**: SAGE now runs to completion with correct single central galaxy per FOF group - major milestone achieved!
- Modified files: src/core/core_build_model.c, src/core/sage.c

2025-06-11: [Memory Management] Memory System Warning Resolution & Cleanup Enhancement âœ… COMPLETED
- **Investigation**: Used lldb debugging to analyze memory warnings and identify normal vs problematic cleanup patterns
- **Discovery**: SAGE uses tree-scoped memory management with bulk cleanup; "unfreed block" warnings represent normal fail-safe behavior
- **Enhancements**: Added allocation tracking, proper I/O cleanup, changed warning to debug logging level
- **Validation**: Confirmed robust memory management handling 8Ã—0.11MB galaxy arrays with proper cleanup
- Modified files: src/core/core_mymalloc.c, src/core/sage.c, src/core/galaxy_array.c, src/core/core_memory_pool.c, src/core/core_array_utils.c

2025-06-13: [Critical Bug Fix] **ðŸŽ‰ HDF5 Galaxy Output Corruption Resolution ðŸŽ‰** âœ… COMPLETED
- **Critical Fix**: Resolved "zero galaxies written to HDF5 output" - files increased from 4MB (empty) to 55MB (populated)
- **Root Cause**: SnapNum corruption during property copying due to blind memcpy overwriting snapshot numbers
- **Solution**: Modified property generator to preserve SnapNum during copying, maintaining architectural integrity
- **Impact**: SAGE now properly writes complete galaxy data to HDF5 files, enabling scientific analysis
- Modified files: src/generate_property_headers.py, src/core/core_properties.c

2025-06-14: [Architecture] **ðŸŽ‰ Core-Physics Property Separation Implementation âœ… COMPLETED
- **Major Fix**: Implemented complete core-physics property separation, eliminating dangerous dual-state synchronization
- **Solution**: Added "merged" core property, replaced physics merger properties in core code, added proper filtering
- **Achievement**: Core code no longer uses physics properties, clean architecture with physics-free mode support
- **Impact**: Ensures merged galaxies don't contaminate results, maintains data integrity through consistent filtering
- Modified files: src/properties.yaml, src/core/physics_pipeline_executor.c, src/core/core_build_model.c, src/core/galaxy_array.c, multiple I/O files

2025-06-14: [Architecture] **ðŸŽ‰ MergTime Property Separation & Senior Developer Recommendations Implementation ðŸŽ‰** âœ… COMPLETED
- **Migration**: Moved MergTime from core to physics property, updated all access patterns to use generic property accessors
- **Cleanup**: Removed all non-core properties from struct GALAXY, simplified deep_copy_galaxy() function per recommendations
- **Achievement**: Core infrastructure operates independently of physics properties, enabling true modularity
- **Validation**: Successfully builds in physics-free mode with complete core-physics separation
- Modified files: src/core/core_build_model.c, src/core/galaxy_array.c, src/physics/physics_essential_functions.c

2025-06-14: [Architecture] **ðŸŽ‰ Function Simplification & Senior Developer Recommendations Implementation ðŸŽ‰** âœ… COMPLETED
- **Simplification**: Refactored init_galaxy() to use auto-generated functions, eliminated duplicate deep copy functions
- **Cleanup**: Removed 150+ lines of manual property synchronization, trusting auto-generated property system
- **Principle**: Functions follow minimal manual work approach - let property system handle what it's designed for
- **Result**: Cleaner, more maintainable code that stays synchronized with properties.yaml changes
- Modified files: src/physics/physics_essential_functions.c, src/core/core_build_model.c, src/core/galaxy_array.c, src/core/core_build_model.h

2025-06-16: [Architecture] Galaxy Initialization Single Source of Truth Implementation âœ… COMPLETED
- **Fix**: Implemented proper galaxy initialization flow - defaults first, then halo data assignment
- **Cleanup**: Eliminated manual synchronization, renamed functions for clarity, updated property defaults
- **Achievement**: Properties serve as single source of truth, eliminated data flow bugs where halo data was overwritten
- **Impact**: Maintains core-physics separation while ensuring proper galaxy initialization sequence
- Modified files: src/generate_property_headers.py, src/physics/physics_essential_functions.c

2025-06-17: [Architecture] **ðŸŽ‰ Dual Property System Elimination Implementation ðŸŽ‰** âœ… COMPLETED
