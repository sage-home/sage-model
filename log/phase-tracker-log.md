# Current Phase: 5/7 (Core Module Migration)

## Phase Objectives
- Implement pipeline execution phases (HALO, GALAXY, POST, FINAL) for handling different scope calculations
- Transform `evolve_galaxies()` to use the pipeline system
- Implement the Properties Module architecture for complete core-physics decoupling
- Create type-safe, centrally-defined galaxy property mechanism
- Achieve complete independence between core infrastructure and physics modules
- Enable the core system to operate correctly with no physics modules
- Migrate physics components as pure add-ons to the core
- Minimize core `struct GALAXY` to remove all physics dependencies
- Validate scientific accuracy against baseline SAGE results
