# Current Phase: 5/7 (Core Module Migration)

## Phase Objectives
- Implement pipeline execution phases (HALO, GALAXY, POST) for handling different scope calculations
- Transform `evolve_galaxies()` to use the pipeline system
- Extract physics components into standalone modules with appropriate phase declarations
- Ensure physics modules register required extension properties
- Implement event dispatching and handling for physics modules
- Integrate module callbacks for cross-module interactions
- Validate scientific accuracy against baseline SAGE results
