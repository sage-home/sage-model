## Recent Milestone: Evolution Diagnostics Core-Physics Separation (May 23, 2025) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

The evolution diagnostics system has been completely redesigned to achieve full core-physics separation compliance, resolving critical architectural violations that were blocking Phase 5.2.G readiness.

**Key Achievements:**
1. **Complete Architectural Redesign**: Removed all hardcoded physics property knowledge from core diagnostics structure
2. **Event System Separation**: Created dedicated physics_events.h/c files, separating physics events from core infrastructure events  
3. **API Modernization**: Updated all function names to core_evolution_diagnostics_* prefix and enhanced error handling
4. **Test System Validation**: Completely rewrote test suite to validate only core infrastructure functionality

**Technical Impact:**
- Core diagnostics now tracks only infrastructure metrics (galaxy counts, phase timing, pipeline performance)
- Physics modules can register their own diagnostic metrics independently
- Demonstrates successful core-physics separation pattern for future system improvements
- Enables true runtime functional modularity for diagnostics

This resolves a major architectural blocker and demonstrates the maturity of the core-physics separation implementation.
