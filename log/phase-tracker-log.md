## Inter-Phase Dependencies
- Phase 1 (Preparatory Refactoring): ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Phase 2 (Module Interfaces): ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- Phase 3 (I/O Abstraction & Memory Optimization): ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Phase 4 (Plugin Infrastructure): ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Phase 5 (Core Module Migration): ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS - **Architectural compliance required before 5.2.G**
- Phase 6 (Advanced Performance Optimization): üîí BLOCKED - Requires complete Phase 5
- Phase 7 (Documentation and Tools): üîí BLOCKED - Requires complete Phase 5

## Critical Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required (Before Phase 5.2.G):
1. **Address Evolution Diagnostics Violations**: Redesign diagnostics system to be physics-agnostic
2. **Audit Core Event System**: Separate core infrastructure events from physics events
3. **Fix Failing Tests**: Update tests to comply with core-physics separation
4. **Core System Review**: Verify all core components are truly physics-agnostic

### Phase 5.2.G Readiness Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Core infrastructure completely physics-agnostic  
- ‚úÖ Empty pipeline runs successfully
- ‚ùå All core systems comply with separation principles (diagnostics violations remain)
- ‚ùå All tests pass with core-physics separation (some tests still fail)
- ‚úÖ Property system ready for physics module development
- ‚úÖ Module infrastructure supports physics module registration

**Status**: Phase 5.2.F is largely complete, but critical architectural violations must be resolved before proceeding to physics module implementation.
## Recent Milestone: Configuration-Driven Pipeline Creation (May 2025) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

The implementation of configuration-driven module activation in pipeline creation has been completed, representing the final infrastructure component for complete core-physics decoupling. The pipeline registry now reads the "modules.instances" array from JSON configuration to determine which modules to activate, with appropriate fallback to using all registered modules when no configuration is available.

**Key Benefits Achieved:**
1. **True Runtime Modularity**: Users can define entirely different sets of active physics modules by changing the configuration file
2. **Complete Core-Physics Decoupling**: Core pipeline creation logic has no compile-time or hardcoded knowledge of specific physics modules  
3. **Enhanced Flexibility**: Facilitates easier experimentation with different combinations of physics modules
4. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Module self-registration makes modules available, while configuration selects and enables them

This completes the core infrastructure requirements for Phase 5.2.F and enables the transition to Phase 5.2.G physics module implementation.
