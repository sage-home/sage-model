# Current Phase: 1.3-1.4/7 (COMPLETED) 

## Phase Objectives
- Complete Phase 1.3: Testing Enhancement
  - Enhance existing end-to-end testing framework
  - Implement robust error logging and assertion system
  - Develop diagnostics to pinpoint issues in the end-to-end tests
  - Create self-validation routines for critical components

- Complete Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
  - Create architectural documentation with component relationships
  - Document data flow between core and physics modules
  - Update inline documentation with clear purpose for each function
  - Create comprehensive README and developer guides

## Current Progress

### Phase 1.3: Testing Enhancement
- [x] GSL Dependency Removal (Prerequisite)
- [x] End-to-end integration tests (basic)
- [x] Enhance existing end-to-end testing framework
- [x] Enhanced error logging system
- [x] Improved verbosity control and output formatting
- [x] Runtime assertions for parameter views
- [x] Self-validation for evolution context
- [x] Improved diagnostics for end-to-end tests (SKIPPED - existing approach sufficient)
- [x] Performance benchmarking points (DEFERRED to Phase 6)

### Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
- [x] Basic inline documentation
- [x] Updated README.md with new structure
- [x] Architecture documentation (SATISFIED by sage-refactoring-plan.md)
- [x] Data flow documentation (SATISFIED by sage-refactoring-plan.md and inline code comments)
- [x] Component relationship diagrams (SATISFIED by project-state-log.md)
- [x] Developer guide (DEFERRED until plugin architecture implementation)

## Completion Note
Phase 1 has been completed with all essential tasks addressed. The team has decided that the existing sage-refactoring-plan.md document serves as comprehensive architecture documentation, while the project-state-log.md provides an overview of the current component relationships. Detailed developer documentation will be more valuable after implementing the plugin architecture in Phase 2.

## Next Phase Preparation
The next phase (Phase 2: Enhanced Module Interface Definition) will focus on:
1. Defining standard interfaces for each physics module type
2. Implementing the galaxy property extension mechanism
3. Creating an event-based communication system
4. Building the module registry and pipeline systems
