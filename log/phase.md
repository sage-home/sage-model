# Current Phase: Tree-Based Processing Implementation

## Phase Objectives
- **PRIMARY**: Transition SAGE from snapshot-based to tree-based processing for scientific accuracy
- **SECONDARY**: Address mass conservation violations and orphan galaxy handling
- Implement depth-first tree traversal following proven Legacy SAGE algorithm
- Preserve all modern improvements (GalaxyArray, property system, pipeline architecture)
- Maintain clean modular architecture with professional coding standards
- Ensure robust testing and validation throughout implementation

## Current Progress

## Inter-Phase Dependencies
- Phase 1 (Tree Infrastructure): ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Foundation ready for galaxy processing
- Phase 2 (Galaxy Collection): üîí BLOCKED - Requires Phase 1 infrastructure
- Phase 3 (FOF Processing): üîí BLOCKED - Requires Phase 2 galaxy collection
- Phase 4 (Physics Integration): üîí BLOCKED - Requires Phase 3 FOF processing  
- Phase 5 (Output Integration): üîí BLOCKED - Requires Phase 4 physics integration
- Phase 6 (Validation): üîí BLOCKED - Requires complete implementation

## Critical Next Steps

### Immediate Actions for Phase 2:
1. **Galaxy Inheritance Design**: Implement collect_halo_galaxies() function following plan specifications
2. **Gap Handling**: Add tree gap measurement and scientific handling logic
3. **Progenitor Collection**: Implement galaxy collection from progenitor halos
4. **Orphan Logic**: Add proper orphan galaxy creation when progenitors have no descendants
5. **Testing Framework**: Create comprehensive tests for galaxy inheritance scenarios

### Key Technical Decisions:
- Follow implementation plan specifications exactly for proven scientific accuracy
- Maintain modern memory management patterns (GalaxyArray, property system)
- Preserve existing physics pipeline architecture
- Use professional C coding practices throughout
