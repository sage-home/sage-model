# Current Phase: 1/7 (Infrastructure Foundation) - Setting Up Modern Development Environment

## Phase Objectives
- **PRIMARY**: Establish CMake build system with out-of-tree builds
- **SECONDARY**: Create abstraction layers for smooth migration
- Implement modern project structure per architecture guide
- Set up development logging for AI support
- Create memory and configuration abstraction layers

## Current Progress

### Task 1.1: CMake Build System Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create root CMakeLists.txt with project configuration
- [x] Set up source file discovery and compilation flags  
- [x] Configure HDF5 and MPI detection
- [x] Enable out-of-tree builds
- [x] Update README with CMake build instructions

### Task 1.2: Directory Reorganization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Move source files to proper subdirectories (core/, physics/, io/)
- [x] Set up docs/ with role-based navigation
- [x] Create log/ directory for AI development support
- [x] Establish tests/ structure for categorized testing
- [x] Git history preservation using git mv commands

### Task 1.3: Memory Abstraction Layer ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create memory.h with allocation macros and file/line tracking
- [x] Implement memory.c with optional tracking (SAGE_MEMORY_TRACKING)
- [x] Create memory_scope.h/c for RAII foundation (Phase 3 prep)
- [x] Update core_mymalloc.h/c for backward compatibility via macros
- [x] Integrate with CMake build system (tracking, AddressSanitizer options)
- [x] Comprehensive testing (test_memory.c) - 100% pass rate
- [x] Scientific validation - all tests pass, no regression

### Task 1.4: Configuration Abstraction Layer ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Design config_t structure for unified access
- [x] Create config.c with modular format support (legacy .par, JSON)
- [x] Add legacy .par file reading with backward compatibility
- [x] Implement configuration validation framework with bounds checking
- [x] CMake integration with optional cJSON dependency
- [x] Comprehensive testing (test_config.c) - 100% pass rate
- [x] Scientific validation - all tests pass, HDF5 output issue resolved

### Task 1.5: Logging System Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create log/README.md with system description
- [x] Set up template files for phases and decisions
- [x] Implement log rotation/archiving system
- [x] Create CLAUDE.md with project overview

## Completion Criteria
**Phase 1 Complete When:**
- CMake build produces working SAGE binary ✅
- All abstraction layers in place and tested
- Development logging system operational ✅
- All tests pass with identical scientific results

**Phase 1 Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All 5/5 tasks completed (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5)

## Phase 1 Achievement Summary
✅ Modern CMake build system with out-of-tree builds
✅ Professional directory structure with preserved git history  
✅ Memory abstraction layer with AddressSanitizer integration
✅ Configuration abstraction layer with dual format support
✅ Development logging system for AI continuity
✅ All tests passing (unit tests + end-to-end scientific validation)

## Phase 1 → Phase 2 Transition Ready
**Infrastructure Foundation Complete** - Ready to begin Phase 2: Property System Core

## Inter-Phase Dependencies
- Phase 2 (Property System Core): ✅ READY - All Phase 1 infrastructure in place
- Phase 3 (Memory Management): ✅ READY - Memory abstraction foundation complete
- Phase 4 (Configuration Unification): ✅ READY - Configuration abstraction framework complete
