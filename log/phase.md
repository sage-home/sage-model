# Current Phase: 1/7 (Infrastructure Foundation) - Setting Up Modern Development Environment

## Phase Objectives
- **PRIMARY**: Establish CMake build system with out-of-tree builds
- **SECONDARY**: Create abstraction layers for smooth migration
- Implement modern project structure per architecture guide
- Set up development logging for AI support
- Create memory and configuration abstraction layers

## Current Progress

### Task 1.1: CMake Build System Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create root CMakeLists.txt with project configuration
- [x] Set up source file discovery and compilation flags  
- [x] Configure HDF5 and MPI detection
- [x] Enable out-of-tree builds
- [x] Update README with CMake build instructions

### Task 1.2: Directory Reorganization ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Move source files to proper subdirectories (core/, physics/, io/)
- [x] Set up docs/ with role-based navigation
- [x] Create log/ directory for AI development support
- [x] Establish tests/ structure for categorized testing
- [x] Git history preservation using git mv commands

### Task 1.3: Memory Abstraction Layer ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create memory.h with allocation macros and file/line tracking
- [x] Implement memory.c with optional tracking (SAGE_MEMORY_TRACKING)
- [x] Create memory_scope.h/c for RAII foundation (Phase 3 prep)
- [x] Update core_mymalloc.h/c for backward compatibility via macros
- [x] Integrate with CMake build system (tracking, AddressSanitizer options)
- [x] Comprehensive testing (test_memory.c) - 100% pass rate
- [x] Scientific validation - all tests pass, no regression

### Task 1.4: Configuration Abstraction Layer ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Design config_t structure for unified access
- [ ] Create config_reader.c with JSON support
- [ ] Add legacy .par file reading to same interface
- [ ] Implement configuration validation framework

### Task 1.5: Logging System Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create log/README.md with system description
- [x] Set up template files for phases and decisions
- [x] Implement log rotation/archiving system
- [x] Create CLAUDE.md with project overview

## Completion Criteria
**Phase 1 Complete When:**
- CMake build produces working SAGE binary ‚úÖ
- All abstraction layers in place and tested
- Development logging system operational ‚úÖ
- All tests pass with identical scientific results

**Phase 1 Status**: 4/5 tasks completed (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5) - Task 1.4 remaining

## Critical Next Steps
1. Implement Task 1.4 configuration abstraction layer 
2. Validate all abstraction layers work correctly
3. Complete Phase 1 exit criteria validation
4. Prepare for Phase 2 (Property System Core) transition

## Inter-Phase Dependencies
- Phase 2 (Property System Core): üîí BLOCKED - Requires complete Phase 1 (only Task 1.4 remaining)
- Phase 3 (Memory Management): ‚úÖ READY - Phase 1 memory abstraction complete (foundation in place)
- Phase 4 (Configuration Unification): üîí BLOCKED - Requires Phase 1 config abstraction (Task 1.4)
