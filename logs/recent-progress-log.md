2025-04-04: [Phase 3.2] Implemented Extended Property Serialization
- Created format-independent utilities for serializing extended galaxy properties
- Implemented binary property header creation and parsing with endianness handling
- Added type-specific serializers and deserializers for all basic property types
- Developed comprehensive test suite for context management, serialization, and endianness handling
- Created detailed documentation on the serialization system architecture and usage
- Modified files: Makefile

2025-04-09: [Phase 3.2 Step 9.1] Implemented Core Validation Framework
- Created comprehensive validation system for ensuring data consistency across I/O formats
- Implemented validation context with configurable strictness levels (RELAXED, NORMAL, STRICT)
- Added core validation functions for pointers, numeric values, bounds, conditions, and format capabilities
- Developed validation utilities for galaxy data validation with detailed error reporting
- Created extensive test suite with validation scenarios and different strictness levels
- Integrated with existing logging system for standardized error reporting
- Modified files: Makefile
- Added files: src/io/io_validation.h, src/io/io_validation.c, tests/test_io_validation.c, docs/io_validation_guide.md, docs/phase3.2_step9.1_implementation_report.md

2025-04-08: [Phase 3.3 Step 4] Implemented Memory Pooling System
- Created comprehensive memory pooling system for efficient GALAXY structure allocation
- Implemented block-based allocation with free list management for efficient reuse
- Added integration with galaxy extension system for proper extension data handling
- Created runtime parameter (EnableGalaxyMemoryPool) for enabling/disabling the system
- Developed standalone test suite with comprehensive validation
- Modified files: src/core/core_allvars.h, src/core/core_init.c, src/core/core_read_parameter_file.c, Makefile, src/physics/model_misc.c
