2025-03-27: [Phase 2.5-2.6] Implemented Pipeline Fallback with Traditional Physics Guarantee
- Implemented a fallback mechanism ensuring traditional physics is used for all modules during migration
- Forced traditional cooling implementation despite module presence to ensure consistent test results
- Added clear comments indicating when/how to re-enable module testing during development
- Updated decision log with the rationale for this approach
- Added code to always handle missing modules by using traditional physics code, with appropriate logging
- Modified files: core_build_model.c, core_pipeline_system.c, logs/decision-log.md

2025-03-28: [Phase 2.7] Completed Module Dependencies Framework Implementation
- Fixed compiler warnings related to sign comparison between enum module_type and int 
- Enhanced type safety with consistent casting throughout the codebase
- Completed testing and validation of all components of the Module Dependencies Framework
- Integrated pipeline invocation with module callback system successfully
- Modified files: core_module_system.c, core_module_callback.c

2025-04-01: [Phase 3] Fixed Redshift Parameter in strip_from_satellite Function
- Found and fixed bug where strip_from_satellite was called with a hardcoded 0.0 value instead of the current redshift
- Extended pipeline_context structure to include redshift field for proper parameter passing
- Updated physics_step_executor to use context->redshift instead of hardcoded value
- Tests now pass and match the original benchmark results from phase 1
- Modified files: core_pipeline_system.h, core_pipeline_system.c, core_build_model.c

2025-04-01: [Phase 3.1] Implemented I/O Interface Abstraction
- Created unified I/O interface structure with capability flags and standardized operations
- Implemented resource tracking system for HDF5 to prevent handle leaks
- Developed handler registry system with format detection capabilities
- Extracted common galaxy output preparation logic from core_save.c
- Added comprehensive error handling system for I/O operations
- Created test suite for I/O interface functionality
- Added documentation on the I/O interface architecture and implementation
- Modified files: Makefile
- Added files: io_interface.h, io_interface.c, io_hdf5_utils.h, io_hdf5_utils.c, io_galaxy_output.h, io_galaxy_output.c, tests/test_io_interface.c, docs/io_interface_guide.md
