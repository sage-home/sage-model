2025-03-27: [Phase 2.5-2.6] Implemented Pipeline Fallback with Traditional Physics Guarantee
- Implemented a fallback mechanism ensuring traditional physics is used for all modules during migration
- Forced traditional cooling implementation despite module presence to ensure consistent test results
- Added clear comments indicating when/how to re-enable module testing during development
- Updated decision log with the rationale for this approach
- Added code to always handle missing modules by using traditional physics code, with appropriate logging
- Modified files: core_build_model.c, core_pipeline_system.c, logs/decision-log.md
