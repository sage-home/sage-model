## Next Actions

### Phase 3.1 Interface Design
1. I/O Interface Definition:
   - Design a unified I/O interface with common operations and resource management functions
   - Add metadata fields including format capabilities and versioning
   - Create a registry for format-specific handlers with automatic format detection
   - Develop comprehensive error handling and validation specific to I/O operations

2. Binary Format Implementation:
   - Refactor the existing binary I/O code into a format-specific implementation
   - Add cross-platform endianness detection and conversion for binary data
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing binary files
   - Implement proper error handling and validation

3. HDF5 Format Implementation:
   - Refactor the existing HDF5 I/O code with improved resource management
   - Implement robust handle tracking to prevent resource leaks
   - Add support for galaxy extensions and custom properties
