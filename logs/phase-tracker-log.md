# Current Phase: 3/7 (I/O Abstraction and Optimization)

## Phase Objectives
- Implement a unified I/O interface that preserves existing functionality
- Create format-specific handlers for different input/output formats
- Add efficient caching strategies for frequently accessed merger tree nodes
- Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- Develop intelligent prefetching for depth-first tree traversal
- Implement memory pooling for galaxy allocations

## Current Progress

### Phase 3.1: I/O Interface Abstraction
- [x] Design unified I/O interface structure with metadata and capabilities
- [x] Implement common I/O operations (initialize, read_forest, write_galaxies, cleanup)
- [x] Add HDF5 resource tracking for handles
- [x] Create registry for format-specific handlers
- [x] Implement format detection and automatic handler selection
- [x] Add error handling and validation for I/O operations

### Phase 3.2: Format-Specific Implementations
- [ ] Refactor binary format handlers to use the common interface
- [x] Add cross-platform endianness detection and conversion
- [ ] Refactor HDF5 format handlers to use the common interface
- [ ] Implement proper HDF5 resource management to prevent handle leaks
- [ ] Implement serialization support for extended properties
- [ ] Add validation for data consistency across formats
- [ ] Create format conversion utilities

### Phase 3.3: Memory Optimization
- [ ] Implement configurable buffered reading/writing with runtime-adjustable buffer sizes
- [ ] Create memory mapping options for large files
- [ ] Design efficient caching for frequently accessed halos
- [ ] Optimize allocation with geometric growth instead of fixed increments
- [ ] Add prefetching for depth-first traversal
- [ ] Implement memory pooling for galaxy allocations

## Next Actions

### Phase 3.2 Format-Specific Implementation
1. Binary Format Handlers:
   - Refactor the existing binary I/O code (read_tree_lhalo_binary.c) to use the common I/O interface
   - Integrate the endianness utilities for cross-platform compatibility
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing binary files
   - Implement proper error handling and validation for binary formats

2. HDF5 Format Handlers:
   - Refactor the existing HDF5 I/O code with improved resource management
   - Leverage the HDF5 resource tracking system to prevent handle leaks
   - Add support for galaxy extensions and custom properties
   - Implement metadata storage with proper attribute handling

3. Galaxy Output Formats:
   - Refactor binary and HDF5 output handlers to use the common interface
   - Implement serialization support for extended properties
   - Ensure consistent format across different output mechanisms
   - Add proper validation for data consistency

4. Validation and Conversion:
   - Add validation functions to ensure data consistency across formats
   - Implement format conversion utilities for migration between formats
   - Create test cases for validation and conversion functionality
   - Document the validation and conversion process

## Completion Criteria
- All I/O operations function through the unified interface
- Format-specific handlers implement all required functionality
- Endianness handling ensures cross-platform compatibility for binary formats
- HDF5 resources are properly tracked and cleaned up with no handle leaks
- Extended properties are properly serialized across formats
- Memory allocation is optimized with geometric growth strategies
- Memory usage is optimized for large merger trees
- Backward compatibility is maintained with existing data files
- Performance improvements are measurable and significant
- All tests passing with the new I/O system
