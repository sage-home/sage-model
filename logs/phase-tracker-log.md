# Current Phase: 3/7 (I/O Abstraction and Optimization)

## Phase Objectives
- Implement a unified I/O interface that preserves existing functionality
- Create format-specific handlers for different input/output formats
- Add efficient caching strategies for frequently accessed merger tree nodes
- Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- Develop intelligent prefetching for depth-first tree traversal
- Implement memory pooling for galaxy allocations

## Current Progress

### Phase 3.1: I/O Interface Abstraction
