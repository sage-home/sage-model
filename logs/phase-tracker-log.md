# Current Phase: 5/7 (Core Module Migration)

## Phase Objectives
- Transform `evolve_galaxies()` to use the pipeline system
- Extract physics components into standalone modules
- Ensure physics modules register required extension properties
- Implement event dispatching and handling for physics modules
- Integrate module callbacks for cross-module interactions
- Validate scientific accuracy against baseline SAGE results

## Current Progress

### Phase 5.1: Refactoring Main Evolution Loop ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Transform `evolve_galaxies()` to use the pipeline system
- [ ] Integrate event dispatch/handling points
- [ ] Add support for reading/writing extension properties
- [ ] Integrate module callbacks
- [ ] Add evolution diagnostics

### Phase 5.2: Converting Physics Modules ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Extract cooling module (already partially implemented)
- [ ] Extract star formation and feedback module
- [ ] Extract infall module
- [ ] Extract mergers module
- [ ] Extract disk instability module
- [ ] Extract reincorporation module
- [ ] Ensure all modules register required extension properties
- [ ] Add event triggers at appropriate points
- [ ] Implement necessary callbacks between modules

### Phase 5.3: Validation and Testing ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Perform scientific validation against baseline SAGE
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks
- [ ] Develop module compatibility tests
- [ ] Add call graph validation

## Completion Criteria
- The main galaxy evolution loop uses the pipeline system
- All physics components are implemented as standalone modules
- Extension properties are properly registered and used by all modules
- Event handling and module callbacks correctly preserve physics interdependencies
- Scientific results match baseline SAGE simulation outputs
- All tests pass, including validation tests
