# Current Phase: 1.3-1.4/7 (Enhanced Testing & Documentation)

## Phase Objectives
- Complete Phase 1.3: Testing Enhancement
  - Enhance existing end-to-end testing framework
  - Implement robust error logging and assertion system
  - Develop diagnostics to pinpoint issues in the end-to-end tests
  - Create self-validation routines for critical components

- Complete Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
  - Create architectural documentation with component relationships
  - Document data flow between core and physics modules
  - Update inline documentation with clear purpose for each function
  - Create comprehensive README and developer guides

## Current Progress

### Phase 1.3: Testing Enhancement
- [x] GSL Dependency Removal (Prerequisite)
- [x] End-to-end integration tests (basic)
- [x] Enhance existing end-to-end testing framework
- [x] Enhanced error logging system
- [x] Improved verbosity control and output formatting
- [x] Runtime assertions for parameter views
- [x] Self-validation for evolution context
- [~] Improved diagnostics for end-to-end tests (SKIPPED - existing approach sufficient)
- [~] Performance benchmarking points (DEFERRED to Phase 6)

### Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
- [x] Basic inline documentation
- [x] Updated README.md with new structure
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Data flow documentation
- [ ] Component relationship diagrams
- [ ] Developer guide

## Next Actions
1. Create architecture documentation with component diagrams: Develop comprehensive documentation of the system architecture including UML-style component diagrams showing relationships between core modules. The documentation will cover both the current state and the planned plugin architecture to guide ongoing development.

2. Document data flow between components: Map the flow of data through the simulation pipeline, identifying key transformation points and dependencies. This documentation will highlight how galaxy properties are modified throughout the evolution process and where component interfaces will need to be formalized for the plugin system.

3. Develop developer guide: Create a comprehensive guide for future developers that explains how to work with the codebase, add new physics modules, and use the testing framework. This will facilitate onboarding of new developers and ensure consistent development practices.

## Completion Criteria
- End-to-end tests passing with improved diagnostics
- Comprehensive error logging throughout codebase
- Runtime assertions for parameter validation
- Self-validation routines for critical components
- Complete architectural and data flow documentation
- Updated inline documentation across all core components
