# Current Phase: 2.5-2.6/7 (Pipeline System & Configuration System)

## Phase Objectives
- Complete Phase 2.5: Module Pipeline System
  - Implement a configurable pipeline for module execution
  - Create pipeline step ordering and validation
  - Build pipeline configuration parsing
  - Design runtime pipeline modification capability
  - Develop pipeline event hooks for extensibility
  
- Complete Phase 2.6: Configuration System
  - Design comprehensive configuration file format
  - Implement configuration parsing and validation
  - Create parameter binding to module settings
  - Build configuration override capabilities
  - Implement runtime configuration updates

## Current Progress

### Phase 2.5: Module Pipeline System
- [ ] Define pipeline interfaces and structures
- [ ] Implement pipeline execution mechanism
- [ ] Create pipeline configuration parsing
- [ ] Build pipeline validation and error checking
- [ ] Implement pipeline modification capabilities
- [ ] Design pipeline event hooks
- [ ] Integrate with the module registry system

### Phase 2.6: Configuration System
- [ ] Design configuration file format (JSON/YAML)
- [ ] Implement configuration file parsing
- [ ] Create parameter validation system
- [ ] Build hierarchical configuration capabilities
- [ ] Implement override mechanisms
- [ ] Create runtime configuration updating
- [ ] Add configuration documentation generation

## Next Actions
1. Design pipeline system architecture: Create a flexible pipeline system that defines the sequence of physics operations during galaxy evolution. This will allow different physics modules to be inserted, replaced, reordered, or removed at runtime according to research needs.

2. Implement configuration file parsing: Develop a parser for configuration files that specify module chains, module parameters, and execution order. This will support both command-line and file-based configuration with proper validation.

3. Integrate pipeline with event system: Connect the pipeline execution with the event system to enable modules to interact during pipeline execution, ensuring proper sequencing and data exchange between physics processes.

## Completion Criteria
- Pipeline system can execute configurable sequences of physics modules
- Module ordering is flexible and can be modified at runtime
- Configuration system supports comprehensive module settings
- Parameter validation prevents invalid configurations
- Runtime changes to pipeline and configuration are supported
- Example implementations demonstrate pipeline flexibility
- All tests passing with the new functionality
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing code
