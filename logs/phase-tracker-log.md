# Current Phase: 2.3-2.4/7 (Event System & Module Registry)

## Phase Objectives
- Complete Phase 2.3: Event-Based Communication System
  - Define event types and data structures
  - Implement event registration and dispatch mechanisms
  - Create event handlers for module communication
  - Build event logging and debugging support
  - Design event filtering capabilities
  
- Complete Phase 2.4: Module Registry System
  - Implement module discovery and registration
  - Create dependency resolution
  - Design module configuration system
  - Build activation/deactivation mechanisms
  - Implement module versioning and compatibility checking

## Current Progress

### Phase 2.3: Event-Based Communication System âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Define event types and structure enums/structs
- [x] Create event system initialization and cleanup
- [x] Implement event registration mechanism
- [x] Design event dispatch system
- [x] Build event handler callback infrastructure
- [x] Add event logging and debugging capabilities
- [x] Create example event types (cooling, star formation, etc.)
- [x] Develop testing framework for events
- [x] Integrate with existing modules (cooling module)

### Phase 2.4: Module Registry System
- [ ] Enhance existing module registry with discovery capabilities
- [ ] Implement dynamic module lookup
- [ ] Create module versioning and compatibility checking
- [ ] Design module configuration parsing
- [ ] Implement dependency resolution algorithm
- [ ] Build activation/deactivation mechanisms
- [ ] Add module error handling and reporting

## Next Actions
1. Build module registry enhancements: Extend the existing module registry to include more sophisticated capabilities such as module discovery, dependency resolution, and configuration. This will enable dynamic loading and configuration of modules at runtime, allowing researchers to easily swap physics implementations without recompilation.

2. Implement module versioning and compatibility: Create a system for checking module compatibility between different versions, ensuring that modules can work together harmoniously even when developed independently. This should include a validation mechanism for checking requirements and capabilities.

3. Design module configuration system: Develop a flexible configuration system that allows researchers to specify which modules to load and how they should be configured. This should support both command-line and file-based configuration options with proper validation.

## Completion Criteria
- Event system infrastructure completed and tested
- Event types defined for key physics interactions
- Module registry enhancements implemented
- Module discovery and dependency resolution working
- Configuration system able to control module loading
- Example implementations demonstrating both systems
- All tests passing with the new functionality
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing code
