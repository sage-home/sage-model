# Current Phase: 5/7 (Core Module Migration)

## Phase Objectives
- Implement pipeline execution phases (HALO, GALAXY, POST) for handling different scope calculations
- Transform `evolve_galaxies()` to use the pipeline system
- Extract physics components into standalone modules with appropriate phase declarations
- Ensure physics modules register required extension properties
- Implement event dispatching and handling for physics modules
- Integrate module callbacks for cross-module interactions
- Validate scientific accuracy against baseline SAGE results

## Current Progress

### Phase 5.1: Refactoring Main Evolution Loop ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement merger event queue approach in traditional architecture
- [x] Implement pipeline phase system (HALO, GALAXY, POST, FINAL)
- [x] Transform `evolve_galaxies()` to use the pipeline system with proper phase handling
- [x] Integrate event dispatch/handling points
- [x] Add support for reading/writing extension properties
- [x] Integrate module callbacks
- [x] Enhance error propagation testing and diagnostic logging
- [x] Add evolution diagnostics

### Phase 5.2: Converting Physics Modules ‚è≥ PENDING
- [ ] Extract cooling module (GALAXY phase)
- [ ] Extract star formation and feedback module (GALAXY phase)
- [ ] Extract infall module (HALO and GALAXY phases)
- [ ] Extract mergers module (POST phase)
- [ ] Extract disk instability module (GALAXY phase)
- [ ] Extract reincorporation module (GALAXY phase)
- [ ] Ensure all modules declare appropriate execution phases
- [ ] Ensure all modules register required extension properties
- [ ] Add event triggers at appropriate points
- [ ] Implement necessary callbacks between modules

### Phase 5.3: Validation and Testing ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Implement integration tests for evolve_galaxies loop phase transitions
- [ ] Perform scientific validation against baseline SAGE

- All physics components are implemented as standalone modules with appropriate phase declarations
- Halo-level calculations (like infall) are executed in the HALO phase
- Galaxy-level calculations (like cooling) are executed in the GALAXY phase
- Post-processing calculations (like mergers) are executed in the POST phase
- Extension properties are properly registered and used by all modules
- Event handling and module callbacks correctly preserve physics interdependencies
- Scientific results match baseline SAGE simulation outputs
- All tests pass, including validation tests
