# Current Phase: 3/7 (I/O Abstraction and Optimization)

## Phase Objectives
- Implement a unified I/O interface that preserves existing functionality
- Create format-specific handlers for different input/output formats
- Add efficient caching strategies for frequently accessed merger tree nodes
- Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- Develop intelligent prefetching for depth-first tree traversal
- Implement memory pooling for galaxy allocations

## Current Progress

### Phase 3.1: I/O Interface Abstraction
- [x] Design unified I/O interface structure with metadata and capabilities
- [x] Implement common I/O operations (initialize, read_forest, write_galaxies, cleanup)
- [x] Add HDF5 resource tracking for handles
- [x] Create registry for format-specific handlers
- [x] Implement format detection and automatic handler selection
- [x] Add error handling and validation for I/O operations

### Phase 3.2: Format-Specific Implementations
- [x] Refactor binary format handlers to use the common interface
- [x] Add cross-platform endianness detection and conversion
- [/] Refactor HDF5 format handlers to use the common interface (framework complete, implementation pending)
- [/] Implement proper HDF5 resource management to prevent handle leaks (framework designed)
- [x] Implement serialization support for extended properties
- [ ] Add validation for data consistency across formats
- [ ] Create format conversion utilities

### Phase 3.3: Memory Optimization
- [ ] Implement configurable buffered reading/writing with runtime-adjustable buffer sizes
- [ ] Create memory mapping options for large files
- [ ] Design efficient caching for frequently accessed halos
- [ ] Optimize allocation with geometric growth instead of fixed increments
- [ ] Add prefetching for depth-first traversal
- [ ] Implement memory pooling for galaxy allocations

## Next Actions

### Phase 3.2 Format-Specific Implementation
