# Current Phase: 1.3-1.4/7 (Enhanced Testing & Documentation)

## Phase Objectives
- Complete Phase 1.3: Testing Enhancement
  - Enhance existing end-to-end testing framework
  - Implement robust error logging and assertion system
  - Develop diagnostics to pinpoint issues in the end-to-end tests
  - Create self-validation routines for critical components

- Complete Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
  - Create architectural documentation with component relationships
  - Document data flow between core and physics modules
  - Update inline documentation with clear purpose for each function
  - Create comprehensive README and developer guides

## Current Progress

### Phase 1.3: Testing Enhancement
- [x] GSL Dependency Removal (Prerequisite)
- [x] End-to-end integration tests (basic)
- [x] Enhance existing end-to-end testing framework
- [x] Enhanced error logging system
- [ ] Runtime assertions for parameter views
- [ ] Self-validation for evolution context
- [ ] Improved diagnostics for end-to-end tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking points

### Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
- [x] Basic inline documentation
- [x] Updated README.md with new structure
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Data flow documentation
- [ ] Component relationship diagrams
- [ ] Developer guide

## Next Actions
1. Add runtime assertions to parameter views
2. Add self-validation to evolution context
3. Improve end-to-end test diagnostics
4. Create architecture documentation with component diagrams
5. Document data flow between components

## Completion Criteria
- End-to-end tests passing with improved diagnostics
- Comprehensive error logging throughout codebase
- Runtime assertions for parameter validation
- Self-validation routines for critical components
- Complete architectural and data flow documentation
- Updated inline documentation across all core components
