# Current Phase: 1.3-1.4/7 (Enhanced Testing & Documentation)

## Phase Objectives
- Complete Phase 1.3: Testing Enhancement
  - Enhance existing end-to-end testing framework
  - Implement robust error logging and assertion system
  - Develop diagnostics to pinpoint issues in the end-to-end tests
  - Create self-validation routines for critical components

- Complete Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
  - Create architectural documentation with component relationships
  - Document data flow between core and physics modules
  - Update inline documentation with clear purpose for each function
  - Create comprehensive README and developer guides

## Current Progress

### Phase 1.3: Testing Enhancement
- [x] GSL Dependency Removal (Prerequisite)
- [x] End-to-end integration tests (basic)
- [x] Enhance existing end-to-end testing framework
- [x] Enhanced error logging system
- [x] Improved verbosity control and output formatting
- [x] Runtime assertions for parameter views
- [x] Self-validation for evolution context
- [ ] Improved diagnostics for end-to-end tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking points

### Phase 1.4: Documentation Enhancement
- [x] Basic inline documentation
- [x] Updated README.md with new structure
- [ ] Architecture documentation
- [ ] Data flow documentation
- [ ] Component relationship diagrams
- [ ] Developer guide

## Next Actions
1. Add runtime assertions to parameter views: Implement boundary checks and type validation for all parameters accessed through parameter views. This will catch invalid parameter values early in the execution pipeline and provide clear error messages about the specific validation failures. This will not only prevent runtime errors but also ensure scientific calculations are based on valid parameter ranges, maintaining the accuracy of the simulation.

2. Add self-validation to evolution context: Create validation routines that check for consistency between related properties in the evolution context. These routines will run at critical points during the simulation to ensure the context remains in a valid state and will provide detailed diagnostics when inconsistencies are detected.

3. Improve end-to-end test diagnostics: Enhance the test_sage.sh script to provide more granular reporting of discrepancies between expected and actual outputs. This will include detailed logging of where deviations occur, visualization of differences for numerical outputs, and contextual information to help pinpoint the source of discrepancies. These improvements will ensure that scientific accuracy is maintained throughout the refactoring process by quickly identifying any changes that affect simulation results.

4. Create architecture documentation with component diagrams: Develop comprehensive documentation of the system architecture including UML-style component diagrams showing relationships between core modules. The documentation will cover both the current state and the planned plugin architecture to guide ongoing development.

5. Document data flow between components: Map the flow of data through the simulation pipeline, identifying key transformation points and dependencies. This documentation will highlight how galaxy properties are modified throughout the evolution process and where component interfaces will need to be formalized for the plugin system.

## Completion Criteria
- End-to-end tests passing with improved diagnostics
- Comprehensive error logging throughout codebase
- Runtime assertions for parameter validation
- Self-validation routines for critical components
- Complete architectural and data flow documentation
- Updated inline documentation across all core components
