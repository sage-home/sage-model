2025-03-19: [Phase 1.2] Evolution Context Implementation
- Implemented evolution_context structure to encapsulate galaxy evolution state
- Replaced global variables with context-based parameters
- Added initialization and cleanup functions for proper lifecycle management
- Updated core functions to use context-based approach

2025-03-20: [Phase 1.1] GSL Dependency Removal
- Removed all GSL dependencies from codebase
- Replaced GSL's integration with simple trapezoidal rule implementation
- Updated the Makefile to remove GSL detection and flags
- Ensured identical results with non-GSL approach
- Modified tests to run without GSL dependency

2025-03-21: [Phase 1.3] Testing Strategy Decision
- Evaluated testing needs for scientific code refactoring
- Decided to prioritize enhanced error logging over unit testing framework
- Focused on improving end-to-end test diagnostics
- Planned implementation of runtime assertions for key components
- Adjusted project plan to reflect updated testing strategy

2025-03-21: [Phase 1.3] End-to-End Testing Framework Enhancement
- Completed the review and validation of the comprehensive end-to-end testing framework
- Confirmed framework provides robust test coverage with binary and HDF5 format support
- Validated that existing test_sage.sh provides download of test trees, environment setup, and output comparison
- Verified sagediff.py includes detailed comparison logic with both relative and absolute tolerances
- Determined no additional enhancement required for current project phase

2025-03-24: [Phase 1.3] Enhanced Error Logging System
- Implemented comprehensive error logging framework with severity levels (DEBUG to FATAL)
- Created context-aware logging for galaxy evolution
- Added color-coded terminal output and configurable formatting
- Integrated with the Makefile VERBOSE flag for level control
- Modified src/core/sage.c, core_build_model.c, core_logging.c, core_parameter_views.c, and core_init.c
