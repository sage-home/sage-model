2025-03-18: [Phase 1.2] Parameter Views Implementation
- Created specialized parameter view structures for each physics module
- Implemented initialization functions for each view
- Reduced coupling between modules by providing only relevant parameters
- Added proper error handling and null pointer checks
- See commits #ae5622f, #b78d21c

2025-03-19: [Phase 1.2] Evolution Context Implementation
- Implemented evolution_context structure to encapsulate galaxy evolution state
- Replaced global variables with context-based parameters
- Added initialization and cleanup functions for proper lifecycle management
- Updated core functions to use context-based approach
- See commits #f5c421a, #d32e98b

2025-03-20: [Phase 1.1] GSL Dependency Removal
- Removed all GSL dependencies from codebase
- Replaced GSL's integration with simple trapezoidal rule implementation
- Updated the Makefile to remove GSL detection and flags
- Ensured identical results with non-GSL approach
- Modified tests to run without GSL dependency
- See commits #7c8d34f, #e921a76

2025-03-21: [Phase 1.3] Testing Strategy Decision
- Evaluated testing needs for scientific code refactoring
- Decided to prioritize enhanced error logging over unit testing framework
- Focused on improving end-to-end test diagnostics
- Planned implementation of runtime assertions for key components
- Adjusted project plan to reflect updated testing strategy

2025-03-21: [Phase 1.3] End-to-End Testing Framework Enhancement
- Completed the review and validation of the comprehensive end-to-end testing framework
- Confirmed framework provides robust test coverage with binary and HDF5 format support
- Validated that existing test_sage.sh provides download of test trees, environment setup, and output comparison
- Verified sagediff.py includes detailed comparison logic with both relative and absolute tolerances
- Determined no additional enhancement required for current project phase
