# Current Phase: 2.3-2.4/7 (Event System & Module Registry)

## Phase Objectives
- Complete Phase 2.3: Event-Based Communication System
  - Define event types and data structures
  - Implement event registration and dispatch mechanisms
  - Create event handlers for module communication
  - Build event logging and debugging support
  - Design event filtering capabilities
  
- Complete Phase 2.4: Module Registry System
  - Implement module discovery and registration
  - Create dependency resolution
  - Design module configuration system
  - Build activation/deactivation mechanisms
  - Implement module versioning and compatibility checking

## Current Progress

### Phase 2.3: Event-Based Communication System
- [ ] Define event types and structure enums/structs
- [ ] Create event system initialization and cleanup
- [ ] Implement event registration mechanism
- [ ] Design event dispatch system
- [ ] Build event handler callback infrastructure
- [ ] Add event logging and debugging capabilities
- [ ] Create example event types (cooling, star formation, etc.)
- [ ] Develop testing framework for events

### Phase 2.4: Module Registry System
- [ ] Enhance existing module registry with discovery capabilities
- [ ] Implement dynamic module lookup
- [ ] Create module versioning and compatibility checking
- [ ] Design module configuration parsing
- [ ] Implement dependency resolution algorithm
- [ ] Build activation/deactivation mechanisms
- [ ] Add module error handling and reporting

## Next Actions
1. Create event system infrastructure: Implement the event system's core components including event types, dispatch mechanism, and handler registration. The design should allow modules to communicate with each other without direct dependencies, enabling more flexible physics pipelines where the execution order can be changed without recompilation.

2. Build module registry enhancements: Extend the existing module registry to include more sophisticated capabilities such as module discovery, dependency resolution, and configuration. This will enable dynamic loading and configuration of modules at runtime, allowing researchers to easily swap physics implementations.

3. Develop example implementations: Create example event producers and consumers to demonstrate the event system in action. This should include modification of at least one existing physics module to use the event system, showing how it simplifies cross-module communication.

## Completion Criteria
- Event system infrastructure completed and tested
- Event types defined for key physics interactions
- Module registry enhancements implemented
- Module discovery and dependency resolution working
- Configuration system able to control module loading
- Example implementations demonstrating both systems
- All tests passing with the new functionality
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing code
